##  CS50W Project-0 : 🔍 Search


This project was developed as part of [CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/) course (Project 0). It demonstrates how HTML forms work and how GET requests are used to send query data to web servers.

The main focus was on:
- Structuring HTML forms
- Using proper `action` and `name` attributes
- Styling pages to resemble Google's aesthetic
- Handling multiple types of search requests via GET parameters
